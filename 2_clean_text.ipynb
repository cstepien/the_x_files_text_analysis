You don\\'t really believe that? I\\'ll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis. Whether it\\'s organic or the result of those marks, I can\\'t say. But to say that they\\'ve been riding around in flying saucers, it\\'s crazy, Mulder, there is nothing to support that. There has got to be an explaination. You\\'ve got four victims.

What were those kids doing out there in the forest? Mulder? We are conducting an investigation. Maybe it has something to do with this. It was all over the ground.
