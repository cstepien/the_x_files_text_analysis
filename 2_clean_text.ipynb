       "'Agent Dana Scully  Yes  sir  Well  sir  I was recruited out of medical school  Um  my parents still think it was an act of rebellion  but  uh    I saw the F B I  as a place where I could distinguish myself  Yes  I am  By reputation  He s an Oxford educated Psychologist  who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult  that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988  Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section  He had a nickname at the academy    Spooky Mulder  I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena  Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X Files project  sir  Agent Mulder  I m Dana Scully  I ve been assigned to work with you  Actually  I m looking forward to working with you  I ve heard a lot about you  If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials  th    Did you bother to read it  Needle punctures  maybe  An animal bite  Electrocution of some kind  It s organic  I don t know  is it some kind of synthetic protein  Do you have a theory  Logically  I would have to say  no   The girl obviously died of something  If it was natural causes  it s plausible that there was something missed in the post mortem  If she was murdered  it s plausible there was a sloppy investigation  What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science  The answers are there  You just have to know where to look  You didn t mention yesterday  this case has already been investigated  And you found something they didn t  The autopsy reports of the first three victims  show no unidentified marks or tissue samples  But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim  Better than you expected or better that you hoped  Is the medical examiner a suspect  I don t know  I ve never had the pleasure  Hi  Hello  We re not insinuating anything  sir  Ray Soames was the third victim  After graduating high school  he spent time in a state mental hospital treated for post adolescent schizophrenia  Exposure  His body was found in the woods after escaping the hospital  Subject is a hundred and fifty six centimeters in length  weighing fifty two pounds in extremis  Corpse is in advance stages of decay and desiccation  Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities  oblate cranium    indicates subject is not human  Could you point that flash away from me  please  It s mammalian  My guess is it s a chimpanzee or something from the ape family  possibly an orangutan  You re serious  You don t honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial  This is somebody s sick joke  Who is it  Pass  No    Were any of those Ray Soames  classmates  Are you treating any of these kids now  They re here at this hospital  Would it be possible for us to talk to them  How did it happen  How did you know that girl was going to have the marks  Damn it  Mulder  cut the crap  What is going on here  What do you know about those marks  What are they  I m here to solve this case  Mulder  I want the truth  By who  You don t really believe that  I ll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis  Whether it s organic or the result of those marks  I can t say  But to say that they ve been riding around in flying saucers  it s crazy  Mulder  there is nothing to support that  There has got to be an explaination  You ve got four victims  All of them died in or near the woods  They found Karen Swenson s body in the forest in her pajamas  ten miles from her house  How did she get there  What were those kids doing out there in the forest  Mulder  We are conducting an investigation  Maybe it has something to do with this  It was all over the ground  I think something is going on out here  some kind of a sacrifice  maybe  What if these kids are involved in some kind of occult and that man knows something about it  What are you looking for  We lost what  Come on  No  what a minute  You re saying that  that time disappeared  Time can t just disappear  it s  it s  it s a universal invariant  Great  I want you to look at something  What are they  Are you sure  Yes  I need to sit down  You never found her  What did you do  By accident  What  Who  I don t understand  And they re afraid of what  That  that you ll leak this information  I m not a part of any agenda  You ve got to trust me  I m here just like you  to solve this  But how do you know    The girl in the wheelchair  We need to ask you a few quest    What  They stole the corpse  There goes my computer  Theresa  your father knows about this  doesn t he  About what happened  No  you re not going to die  They know Mulder  They know who s responsible for the murders  Dr  Nemman s been hiding medical evidence from the beginning  He lied on the autopsy reports and now we find out about the detective  Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms  I don t know  I    What is going on here  Who  The detective  The boy in the hospital  The vegetable   Billy Miles  a boy who s been in a coma for the last four years  got out here and dug up these graves  This fits a profile  Peggy O Dell s watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine  I made a note of it when I saw the body  And the force summoned Theresa Nemman s body into the woods tonight  Where are we going  Mulder  take a look at this  That kid may have killed Peggy O Dell  I don t believe this  It s crazy  He was in the woods  This is the same stuff that I took a handful of in the forest  We lost the original sample in the fire  What else could it be  You said it yourself  You re right  We ll take another sample from the forest    and run a comparison before we do anything  The detective s here  What do you think  Mulder  what happened  There was a light  Yes  sir  My reports are personal and subjective  I don t think I ve gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what I ve seen  I can t substantiate it  no  There were  of course  crimes committed  This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication device  I removed it from the exumed body  Agent Mulder believes we are not alone  Hello  Y  yes  Tomorrow '"
